            <p class="text-subtle text-lg">
              I am a seasoned software engineer with nine years of expertise,
              backed by a degree in Software Engineering. My journey in web
              development, which began in 2015, is fueled by a passion for
              enhancing web app performance and code maintainability. My toolkit
              includes JavaScript, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, and Git. Additionally, I
              thrive in collaborating across various facets of software
              engineering, from requirements analysis to design.

                Designed and implemented a Slack application using Ruby on Rails
                and Sidekiq that seamlessly integrates our company's services
                and simplifies the account creation process for our users. The
                application incorporates robust OAuth 2 and Slack Identity
                Transfer flows, and also includes a command that enables users
                to initiate a new screen recording directly from their Slack
                workspace.
              </li>
              <li>
                I harnessed the power of the Atlassian Forge framework and Vue 3
                to craft a Jira application. This tool empowers users to launch
                screen recordings seamlessly from within a Jira Ticket. This
                integration enhances team collaboration, allowing users to
                capture and convey detailed information efficiently, thereby
                streamlining the issue resolution workflow.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed a custom Microsoft Teams bot that enables users to
                receive real-time notifications from our platform. By leveraging
                this bot, our users can stay up-to-date with their CloudApp
                activity and receive important updates directly in their
                Microsoft Teams workspace.
              </li>
              <li>
                Responsible for both bug fixing and implementing new features.
                In this role, I worked with a range of cutting-edge
                technologies, including Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Sidekiq, and
                Vue.js. By leveraging these tools, I was able to enhance the
                overall performance and user experience of our application.
